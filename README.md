# Trigger development for Anticipatory action -HI

 510, is providing technical support to the  “Towards greater impact of anticipatory action (I2A)" project from Humanité & Inclusion (HI) and specifically “Development of a disaster impact-based forecasting model for inclusive anticipatory action”. This repository is to document project deliverables 
 
 HI is an international organization committed to addressing poverty, exclusion, conflict, and disaster in approximately fifty countries. HI collaborates with individuals with disabilities and vulnerable populations to fulfill their essential needs, enhance their living conditions, and uphold their dignity and fundamental rights. The organization consists of a Federation and eight national member associations, including those in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. 
 The specific work in this project is to support HI's mission in the Philippines, where HI has been active since 1985, promoting meaningful participation for those at risk of exclusion to improve safety, resilience, and quality of life. Their focus includes employment and livelihood support, protection and risk reduction, health and prevention. 
 
 The study in the Philippines, under Outcome 1 of the project, seeks to develop an inclusive forecast-based anticipation model for cyclones and cyclone-related floods. This model will serve as the basis for the creation of early action protocols, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable populations. The study involves various stages, including data analysis, risk mapping, and the development of an anticipation model. It also encourages stakeholder participation, including local authorities, civil society representatives, experts, and disability organizations, to ensure inclusivity and validation of key steps. 
 
 The study's ultimate goal is to better anticipate and prevent cyclone-related risks, limit damage to populations, and support decision-making. It will provide a foundation for inclusive early action protocols, contributing to the overall mission of strengthening resilience among at-risk communities in the Philippines.
